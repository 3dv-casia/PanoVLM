21/11/2012 OsiCpx

    needs SoPlex >= 1.5.0.7

03/09/2011 OsiMsk
  - fix bug in one loadProblem method when NULL was passed as row range array

30/07/2011 Osi
  - fix writing LP files with names: the objective name was not copied, leading to a segfault in CoinLpIO

  - add isLicenseError() to check whether last solve was abandoned due to a mosek licensing issue 

22/06/2011 OsiCpx
  - fix handling of primal/dual objective limit so it correctly takes objoffset into account
  - preserve objective sense also when empty model is loaded
  - make sure getWarmStart returns proper atlower/atupper status for inequalities

13/06/2011 OsiCommonTest, unittest
  - removed now redundant counting of unittest failures, so test functions now return void 

03/06/2011 OsiMsk
  - fix caching flags (bitwise negation is ~, not !)
  - free all cached data when loading problem
  - fix getDualRay and getPrimalRay so they should return a ray now 
  - fixed various further issues in unittest, so OsiMsk passes it now

15/05/2011 OsiXpr
  - added option (mipstart) to pass column solution as initial solution to a MIP solve

30/04/2011 OsiCpx, OsiGrb
  - added option (mipstart) to pass column solution as initial solution to a MIP solve
