OPEN SOLVER INTERFACE LIBRARY README
=============================

In this README,

1. 'coin-Osi' is the full path to the directory in which you have 
   dowloaded Osi.

2. 'build' is the full path to the directory used for the installation 
   of Osi. It might be coin-Osi or some other directory of your choosing.


OVERVIEW
========

Welcome to the COIN-OR Open Solver Interface Library (Osi). Osi is
distributed under the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 and is freely
redistributable. All source code and documentation is copyright by
International Business Machines Corporation and (many) others.  This README
file may be distributed freely.

The COIN-OR Open Solver Interface Library is a collection of solver
interfaces (SIs) that provide a common interface --- the OSI API --- for all
the supported solvers.

Each SI is in a separate directory. The authors of each SI are listed in the
AUTHORS file in the subdirectory.  The names of maintainers and contributors
to the base OsiSolverInterface code are listed in the AUTHORS file in this
(Osi) directory.  For more information, see the Osi Trac page (see below).

INSTALLATION
============

If you have downloaded the Osi package in the local directory coin-Osi,
please see the INSTALL file in coin-Osi (the parent directory of this
directory, unless you've changed the default Coin package directory
structure) for instructions on how to install the entire package.

If you have obtained Osi by downloading some other package, Osi will be 
installed as part of the installation of that package. See the INSTALL 
file in the main directory of the package (again, the parent directory of this
directory).


SUPPORT
=======

1. Authors

   See the AUTHORS file.

2. Project Managers

   The main project managers are

     Lou Hafer, lou@cs.sfu.ca
     Matt Saltzmann, mjs@clemson.edu

   Lots of others help out.

3. Mailing List

   Casual discussion of Osi can usually be found in the coin-discuss mailing
   list. Serious discussion occurs in the coin-osi-devel mailing list. To
   subscribe to either, go to http://list.coin-or.org/mailman/listinfo and
   follow the links.

4. Bug Reports

   Bug reports should be reported by creating a ticket at
   https://projects.coin-or.org/Osi/newticket

   You will need to create a login id. We apologise for the hassle, but it's
   the only way to avoid spammers. The more you can tell us about the bug
   (version of Osi, compiler version, operating system, etc.) the better the
   chance that we can duplicate your bug and fix it. It's helpful if you
   leave a valid email address, in case we need to contact you for more
   information.

   You can also report bugs on the mailing lists, but you're at the mercy of
   the memory of the developers. Once that email gets filed, well, out of
   sight, out of mind.

5. Requests for Enhancements

   As for bugs, please create a ticket. Or, join the coin-osi-devel list and
   lobby directly.
