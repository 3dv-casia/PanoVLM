 * Include file for the configuration of Clp.
 *
 * On systems where the code is configured with the configure script
 * (i.e., compilation is always done with HAVE_CONFIG_H defined), this
 * header file includes the automatically generated header file.
 *
 * On systems that are compiled in other ways (e.g., with the
 * Developer Studio), a header files is included to define those
 * macros that depend on the operating system and the compiler.  The
 * macros that define the configuration of the particular user setting
 * (e.g., presence of other COIN-OR packages or third party code) are set
 * by the files config_*default.h. The project maintainer needs to remember
 * to update these file and choose reasonable defines.
 * A user can modify the default setting by editing the config_*default.h files.
