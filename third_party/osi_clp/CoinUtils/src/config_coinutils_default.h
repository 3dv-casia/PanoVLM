  Define to 64bit integer types. Note that MS does not provide __uint64.

  Microsoft defines types in BaseTsd.h, part of the Windows SDK. Given
  that this file only gets used in the Visual Studio environment, it
  seems to me we'll be better off simply including it and using the
  types MS defines. But since I have no idea of history here, I'll leave
  all of this inside the guard for MSC_VER >= 1200. If you're reading this
  and have been developing in MSVS long enough to know, fix it.  -- lh, 100915 --
